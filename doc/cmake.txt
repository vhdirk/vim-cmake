INTRODUCTION                                    *cmake*

When working on a CMake project, this plugin provides a single command that
changes the makeprg make command's working directory to the closest 'build'
directory (see g:cmake_build_dir) upwards

COMMANDS                                        *cmake-commands*

:CMake [args]           Runs the cmake command as 'cmake ..', starting in
                        first directory called 'build', found in an upwards
                        search. All arguments are directly passed on to CMake.
                        Also modifies the :make command to build in
                        that directory.

:CMakeClean                      deletes all files in the build directory. You can
                                 think of this as a CMake version of make clean.
